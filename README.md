# NAUTILUS
Web server data analysis
## Galvanize Capstone Project


This project aims to collect data about a web server, and present it as meaningful information to a software engineer. Seeing the information in a new way can help a developer understand how people use their site. It can help them make better decisions about future changes, see usage patterns, and help troubleshoot issues with the site.
